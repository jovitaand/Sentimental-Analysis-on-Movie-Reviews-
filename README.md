# Kaggle: Sentiment Analysis on Movie Reviews

The **Sentiment Analysis on Movie Reviews** competition on Kaggle challenges participants to build models that can predict the sentiment of movie reviews. The dataset is derived from Rotten Tomatoes, where each review is labeled with one of five sentiment categories:

- **0**: Negative
- **1**: Somewhat Negative
- **2**: Neutral
- **3**: Somewhat Positive
- **4**: Positive

### Objective:
The goal is to classify each movie review based on its sentiment. This is a supervised learning problem where the input data is a sequence of text (the review), and the output is one of the five sentiment categories.

### Dataset:
- **Train Set**: Contains the movie reviews along with their corresponding sentiment labels.
- **Test Set**: Used to evaluate model performance with sentiment predictions that need to be submitted for scoring.

### Applications:
Sentiment analysis is a popular natural language processing (NLP) task, and this competition helps participants enhance their understanding of techniques such as:
- Text preprocessing (tokenization, stemming, etc.)
- Feature extraction (TF-IDF, Word2Vec, etc.)
- Building classification models using machine learning or deep learning techniques (e.g., logistic regression, SVM, LSTM, BERT).

### Evaluation:
The competition is scored based on **classification accuracy**, rewarding models that most accurately predict the sentiment of the movie reviews in the test set.
